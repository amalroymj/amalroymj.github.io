<h3>About The College:</h3>
<p>The College was founded in 1967 as the Conestoga College of Applied Arts and Technology, one of many such institutions established in that time by the Ontario government to grant diplomas and certificates in career-related, skills-oriented programs. It was renamed in 2002 when the government extended the school's reach, namely to grant degrees in technology-based fields.

Over the years, it has added additional programs such as the Master of Business Administration program, in cooperation with the University of Windsor. In addition, the College offers a new nursing curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.Sc.N.) degree. Students accepted to Conestogaâ€™s Nursing Program will take all four years of study at the Doon Campus in Kitchener. Graduates of the program will receive a degree from McMaster University.</p>

<p>Beginning in August 2003 two new programs began which would be the first to award a degree to students entirely through the college. The two programs are the B.Eng. Mechanical Systems Engineering program, a fully accredited engineering program by Engineers Canada and the B.A.Tech Architecture - Project and Facility Management. In 2007 a third B.A. Tech in Integrated Telecommunication and Computer Technology, degree program was added targeting embedded system hardware and software design and manufacture. All three programs award graduates a Bachelor of Applied Technology degree. Beginning of 2005 a new Bachelor of Applied Health Sciences Degree in Health Informatics Management; was started in the School of Health Sciences, Community Services and Biotechnology.

In 2006, the college purchased the former University Heights Secondary School in Waterloo for nearly $6,000,000, into which its Waterloo campus relocated later that year. The property is significantly larger than its former Waterloo campus, which the college will sell to cover the cost of the purchase.</p>
