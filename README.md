    This is two pages: login and registration page. There should be a form that performs a GET operation to the dashboard page. 
    The login should take a username and a password
    The registration should take email, username and password.
    Use HTTP form to GET to the dashboard page.
2. There should be a Dashboard page.

    The dashboard should have a link to a page that adds transaction categories. (This doesn't have to actually work, just the html elements should be laid out and style d accordingly)
    The dashboard should have a link (or a menu item preferably) to transactions that will filter the list based on different transaction categories.
    The filtering categories will be: Date(Month), Transaction Types, Location
    The dashboard should show the 4 or more most recent transactions
3. There should be a page to show the details of the transactions

    The page should show when a transaction occurred
    The page should show where (if available). If where is not available then the transaction description is used instead.

A transaction is the following bits of data: Date, Description, Value. (negative if you spent money, positive if you earned it
